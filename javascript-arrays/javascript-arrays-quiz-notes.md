## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are arrays used for?
They're used to store a list of values that are usually related to each other

Arrays allow you to create lists without having to create a variable for each value (do not need to specify how many values it will hold)

- What number represents the first index of an array?
0

- What is the `length` property of an array?
It provides the number of items in an array

- How do you calculate the last index of an array?
You would take the length of the array and subtract 1 since the index starts at 0
