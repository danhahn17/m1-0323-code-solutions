## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
A set of statements used to perform a task/calculate a value by using an input and giving an output

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
function keyword + optional function name + comma separated list of zero or more parameters surrounded by parentheses + { + code block + optional optional return statement + }

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
function name + parentheses + ;

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
Definition contains the function keyword and the code block whereas the Call only contains the function name + () + ;

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
A parameter is more of a placeholder whose value is not known until we call the function and pass a argument. We declare parameters and pass arguments through the function.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
They act as placeholders for variables that are not known until we pass an argument through.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
The return statement causes the function to produce a value/output and prevents any more code from being run in the function's code block.
